This directory contains a set of examples that solve simple problems
or approximately reproduce simulation results in existing publications.
For a quick set of examples and instructions on how to run the them,
refer to the directories 1d/ for a simple non-MPI script, and
MPI_example/ for a simple MPI script.

Generally, the examples are run by:
